# Exploration-of-Datasets-for-ML
In this project, I delved into the Walmart dataset, conducting Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Feature Engineering. Using tools like Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly, I explored the dataset to gain valuable insights. Additionally, I tackled the Used Cars Prices in the Canadian Market dataset, employing Regression with XGBoost and Regression with ElasticNet after performing EDA and feature engineering.
